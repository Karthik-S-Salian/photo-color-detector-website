Color Picker Project
This project is a color picker tool that allows users to select colors from an image displayed on a canvas. Users can hover over the image to retrieve the RGB values of the selected color. Additionally, they can toggle a lock to freeze the color selection and copy the RGB value to their clipboard.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in a web browser.
The canvas will display an image by default (color_street.avif), but you can choose a different image by clicking on the "Choose File" button and selecting an image file.
Move your mouse over the canvas to select colors from the image. The RGB value of the selected color will be displayed in the "RGB" section.
If you want to lock the color selection, click on the canvas. This will freeze the selected color, allowing you to copy the RGB value using the "Copy" button.
Resize the canvas by adjusting the size of the browser window. The canvas will automatically adjust its dimensions to fit the window.

The project relies on the following dependencies:

Canvas API: Used to manipulate and draw on the canvas element.
